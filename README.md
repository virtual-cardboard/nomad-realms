# Nomad Realms

Nomad Realms is a game where you explore, build, and survive in a tile-based procedurally generated world. You play as a nomad who must gather resources, craft items, and build structures to survive and thrive in the world. The game features a real-time card action system, where you use cards to perform actions such as moving, attacking, and building, and otherwise interacting with the world.
